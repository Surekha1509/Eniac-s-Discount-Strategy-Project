Project Overview
The study focuses on understanding how monthly revenue and the average discount rate influenced sales performance during 2017–2018. Additionally, it explores the relationship between discounts, seasonal shifts, special events, product categories, and various pricing and quantity dynamics.

Objective
The primary goal is to assess the impact of Eniac's discounting strategy on sales performance, product categorization, and seasonal variations. Insights from this analysis aim to guide optimization of discount distribution across product categories and months.

Data Source
The dataset was sourced from Eniac's discount database for the period 2017–2018. Rigorous data cleaning was performed to address issues including a corrupted database, incongruent or duplicate data, irregular numeric formats (e.g., double-dot numbers), and general data quality concerns.

Tools Used

Python (Google Colab) for data analysis

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning

Seaborn for statistical visualization

Data Cleaning Process
The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process to ensure data integrity:

Corrupted Database: Identified and resolved database issues affecting integrity.

Incongruent Data: Corrected inconsistencies, duplicates, and mismatched records.

Double-Dot Numbers: Fixed anomalies in numerical values, particularly duplicated or irregular decimal points.

Data Quality Concerns: Addressed missing or unreliable data to enhance overall dataset reliability.

Analysis and Key Findings

Higher discounts do not necessarily lead to higher revenue.

Blanket high-rate discount strategies are less effective; strategic, time-limited offers are recommended.

Recommendations

Maintain discounts within a reasonable range to preserve profit margins.

Improve data collection processes and extend observation periods to better capture seasonal trends.

Standardize product categorization and implement duplicate checks for cleaner, more reliable analysis in the future.
