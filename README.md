This project analyzes the discount strategy applied by ENIAC between January 2017 and March 2018. After cleaning the data and classifying the products sold by ENIAC, we recommend that the company continue offering discounts in the range of 15% to 25%. Additionally, we suggest applying significantly higher discounts on expensive products during special occasions, such as Black Friday and the Christmas holidays, to further boost revenue
